customers data is of paramount importance to us, and we take multiple steps to protect that data from unauthorized disclosure.</p>\n                  <h4>Authentication, Integrity, and Encryption</h4>\n                  <p>Both We and Our Internet as a Service (IaaS) provider, Google Cloud Platform, employ several security measures to help ensure the authenticity, integrity, and privacy of data in transit and while at rest.</p>\n                  <ul>\n                    <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> we verify the data source, either a human or a process, and destination.</li>\n                    <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> we make sure data you send arrives at its destination unaltered.</li>\n                    <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> we make your data unintelligible while in transit to keep it private and protected.</li>\n                  </ul>\n                  <h4>Encryption protects your data in three ways:</h4>\n                  <ul>\n                    <li><strong>Encryption at rest:</strong> protects your data from a system compromise or data exfiltration by encrypting data while stored. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is often used to encrypt data at rest.</li>\n                    <li><strong>Encryption in transit:</strong> protects your data if communications are intercepted while data moves between your site and the cloud provider or between two services.</li>\n                    <li><strong>Encryption in use:</strong> protects your data when it is being used by servers to run computations, e.g. homomorphic encryption.</li>\n                  </ul>\n                  <h4>Hashed passwords</h4>\n                  <p>All passwords for our accounts and logins for our services and systems are protected using Strong Hashing. Hashing is the act of converting passwords into unreadable strings of characters that are designed to be nearly impossible to convert back into a readable form. We also use internal methods to test all saved and stored passwords to make sure they are strong enough not to be easily cracked by intrusion methods. If we discover that your password is not strong enough, we reset it automatically to a strong one and then email you a notice that we have with a one time link to login and change it.</p>\n                  <h4>User access monitoring</h4>\n                  <p>Employee, approved vendors, and customers who access our systems and services are logged. Those logs include the username used to login, timestamps, areas accessed, locatioms, and other data designed to help us investate security incidents and to protect our systems and data.</p>\n                  <h4>Training, reporting, and compliance</h4>\n                  <p>We created our business from the ground up, starting with security. We provide multiple avenues of training for our employees, vendors, and customers, including written training materials, videos, newsletters, articles, and formal programs all designed to keep focus on the security of our systems and data we store. We provide extra incentives for all users of our systems to report any suspicious or unusual activity. Our approach to security also includes enforcing compliance and limiting access to only what is actually necessary for people who use our systems.</p>\n                  <h4>Intrusion detection</h4>\n                  <p>We use 24 hour, defense in depth security processes, which include monitoring our websites, networks, and servers for unusual activity or activity that is not authorized. Those methods also include firewalls, scanning, and alerts for attempts to intrude into our systems.</p>\n                  <h4>Server and application firewalls</h4>\n                  <p>We deploy firewall software and hardware that use rules to help prevent unauthorized access to applications and data that reside on our systems. For example, bad actors often try to gain access to networks and servers through open ports. Our firewalls block access to ports we don't specifically use and secure by other methods. Firewalls also contain rules that block access to IP addresses known for brute force and other attack vectors.</p>\n                  <h4>Routine internal audit</h4>\n                  <p>We perform routine and unanounced audits using our own internal methods and by third party security assets. These audits are designed to test our systems for vulnerabilites, and ensure that employees, customers and others follow our security policies and guidelines. We use what we learn from these audits to correct deficiencies and vulnerabilities and correct poor security practices by the people who use them.</p>\n                  <h4>Google Cloud Platform physical and virtual security</h4>\n                  <p>One of the primary reasons why we chose Google as our Internet as a Service (IaaS) provider is because of the extraordinary level and focus they have on physical and virtual security. They employ some of the world's foremost experts in information, application, and network security. We use their model in creating our own.

Please be aware that We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.</p>\n                  <h4>By lawful order</h4>\n                  <p>Like all businesses operating in the United States and elsewhere we are legally required to divulge any information so ordered and executed by proper legal authority. In cases where we disagree with an order we may pursue relief from an order, but we are ultimately required to comply with the legal outcomes of those challenges.</p>\n                  <h4>Legal proceedings</h4>\n                  <p>In the even of legal proceedings, including but not limited to law suits filed for or against us, collection of debts owed to us, and if we are subpoened to provide information by law, we will comply with those orders.</p>\n                  <h4>In case of imminent danger</h4>\n                  <p>If we have reason to believe that any action, behavior, or incident could put our customers or staff in physical danger, we may divulge personally identifying at our discretion at any time. Examples of this include threats of physical violence to persons or property, stalking, when we have reason to believe someone may injure themselves or others, or similar acts. We will immediately notify proper legal authority and work with them as we deem necessary.</p>\n                  <h4>International data transfers</h4>\n                  <p>Like other businesses that host web sites and perform certain services involving information, it is necessary for us to permit the transfer of data, including data that may contain personally identifying information, to servers and storage locations outside our physical address. This is necessary for many reasons. For example, our hosting plans allow people to choose from among several physical datacenter locations, both inside and beyond the borders of the United States, so their website is located closer to the location where their users are. This reduces latency and other bottlenecks that slow performance of web sites.</p>\n                  <p>Our Internet as a Service (IaaS) provider requires datacenters located outside the United States, and the European Union, to agree to and comply with the same security and best practives they depend inside those bounderies. The most important point about inernational data transfers is that we live in a connected world where information is transmitted at the speed of light to datacenters and carriers all over the globe. However, we take reasonable precautions to make sure your data is secured while in transit and while at rest no matter the location.</p>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"ts-content-grid-box\">\n                  <h2 class=\"text-headline\">How long do we store personally identifying information?</h2>\n                  <p>This Website contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Pressmedics LLC.
